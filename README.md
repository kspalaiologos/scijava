## FAQ
- Your library does not support $MY_ARCHITECTURE.

If the GCC crosscompiler for the architecture you run is available in Ubuntu/Debian repositories and supported by Rust, feel free to open a ticket.

- I use musl.

My condolences.

- Will you support MacOS and FreeBSD?

PRs for the Actions artifact builder welcome.
